# Customer_segmentation
Customer_segmentation
Most Banks and credit card companies competing in similar segments with similar products are finding it hard to differentiate themselves. The challenge for these companies is to align the right value proposition with the right consumers. The answer lies in advanced customer segmentation based on customer financial behavior towards range of consumer finance products and markets i.e How Banks and credit card companies do segmentation for credit card customers based on customer financial behavior.

Target population
U.S. adult population of 18 years of age or older. I have selected this group since adult population of 18 years of age or older are potential customers of Banks/Credit card companies.
Data Preparation
I selected 17 variables ( 2 demographics and 15 behavior variables) and cleaned and prepared the variables before segmentation system. I used 2d array in SAS to find missing variables
